<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Cataract Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Foldable Lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intraocular cataract lenses market comprises two primary types: non-foldable lenses and foldable lenses. Non-foldable lenses are rigid, often made from materials like polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and require larger incisions for implantation, making them less commonly used today.
