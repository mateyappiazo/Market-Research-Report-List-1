<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UHT Milk Processing Line Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct UHT</li><li>Indirect UHT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The UHT milk processing line market is categorized into two primary types: direct UHT and indirect UHT. Direct UHT processing involves rapidly heating milk using direct contact with steam, resulting in immediate pasteurization and preservation of flavors and nutrients. In contrast, indirect UHT employs heat exchangers where milk is heated by hot surfaces or water, preventing flavor changes but potentially requiring longer processing times. Both methods aim to extend shelf life while maintaining product quality for consumers.</p></p>
