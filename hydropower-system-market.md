<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydropower System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Turbines</li><li>Reaction Turbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydropower system market comprises two main types of turbines: impulse turbines and reaction turbines. Impulse turbines, like the Pelton wheel, utilize the kinetic energy of water jets to drive the turbine, making them ideal for high-head applications. In contrast, reaction turbines, such as Francis and Kaplan turbines, generate power by the pressure and flow of water below the surface, suitable for low to medium head sites. Both types play crucial roles in harnessing renewable energy from water sources.</p></p>
