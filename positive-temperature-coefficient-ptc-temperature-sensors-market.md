<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPTC Temperature Sensor</li><li>PPTC Temperature Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) temperature sensor market is primarily divided into two types: CPTC (Ceramic Positive Temperature Coefficient) and PPTC (Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient) temperature sensors. CPTC sensors are made from ceramic materials and exhibit a significant increase in resistance as temperature rises, making them suitable for precision temperature measurements. In contrast, PPTC sensors use polymeric materials and are often utilized for overcurrent protection in electronics, as they reset automatically once the temperature decreases. Both types have distinct applications across various industries.</p></p>
